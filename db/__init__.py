"""Database helpers package for the Tracking Program for accounting.

This module intentionally contains only a small module-level docstring so
the package can be safely imported by other modules. Heavy initialization
and database helpers live in :mod:`db.db` and should be imported explicitly
when needed (for example ``from db import db as dbmod``).
