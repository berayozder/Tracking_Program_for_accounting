Analytics and business reports

Platform/category profitability
New window to show revenue/COGS/profit by platform and by category/subcategory; trend lines and top/N lists.
Supplier and customer analytics
LTV by customer, repeat rate; supplier on-time stats, average cost, and lead times.

Accounting, currency, and tax (from your notes)

Currency conversion (TRY/USD)
FX-aware totals and a small widget to pick conversion rate; store rate per transaction for historical accuracy.
VAT/KDV support
VAT-inclusive/exclusive amounts on imports and expenses; add a VAT report and proper fields in forms.

Data model and integrity

Migrate sales/returns to SQLite
Keep CSV export, but store canonical data in DB for better joins, constraints, and performance.

Constraints and validation
Add stronger DB constraints (e.g., non-null and foreign-key checks) and UI validation with clear error messages.

Security and audit (from your notes)

Integrations (from your notes)
Marketplaces
Start with CSV imports/exports that match Amazon/Hepsiburada formats; later add API-based sync for orders/products.

Performance and stability

Pagination/virtualized tables
For very large datasets, add paging in viewers or lazy-load rows.
Backups and restore UI
One-click backup (zip data/), scheduled background backups, and restore flow.
Developer experience and quality

Packaging
Build a distributable app (PyInstaller) with platform-specific bundles (DMG/EXE).
CI and tests
Add a minimal test suite for db.py and run in CI; add mypy and ruff or flake8.
Requirements and docs
Pin versions in requirements.txt (include ttkbootstrap) and extend README with a short “Preferences & Icons” section.



//where it may differ
Rich Batch / FIFO Tracking + Cost/Profit Analytics
This is a non-trivial feature and not every free or cheap software has accurate per-batch cost tracking. If you implement that well (with imports, remaining stock, sales allocation), it's a strong differentiator.
