# Tracking Program for Accounting

A simple desktop app to track imports, inventory, sales, expenses, returns, and documents. Built with Python (Tkinter + ttk/ttkbootstrap) and SQLite/CSV.

> Note: This is my personal side project and it‚Äôs under active development.

## Highlights
- Imports, Sales, Expenses, Returns with multi‚Äëdocument attachments
- FIFO batch tracking with per‚Äësale cost/profit and optional expense apportion
- Base currency and date‚Äëbased FX rates (Frankfurter) with local cache

## Recent updates (important)

- Base currency is now selected once during the application's initial setup and is intentionally locked thereafter to preserve historical accounting data. On first run the app will prompt you to choose the base currency. The Settings window shows the chosen base but will not allow changing it ‚Äî changing the stored base requires an explicit migration (backup + dry-run + audit) and is not performed automatically.

- Import batches now persist the FX rate and the unit cost in base currency (`fx_to_base` and `unit_cost_base`) at the time of import. The Record Import UI shows a suggested FX rate (from cached historical rates) and allows a manual override which is then persisted with the import batch.

- Returns have been migrated into the DB (stored with `refund_amount_base`) and the `insert_return()` flow is atomic: when a return is recorded with restock enabled the app will update import batch remaining quantities and inventory and mark the return as `restock_processed` to avoid double-application. Returns now affect analytics (monthly/yearly and batch reports) ‚Äî returned rows are visually marked in the Sales view and analytics prefer the persisted base-costs when available.

- Analytics & Reporting: reporting functions prefer the stored `unit_cost_base`/`fx_to_base` values for reproducible historical COGS and profit calculations. If historical batches lack `unit_cost_base`, the app can fall back to original columns or a backfill script (recommended) can compute and persist missing base-costs.
- Suppliers and Customers directories (optional linkage)
- Consistent, themed UI with sortable/searchable tables
- Login with hashed passwords and audit log (admin features in UI)

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- macOS/Windows/Linux
- Optional: ttkbootstrap for nicer theming (falls back to ttk)

## Install
```bash
# Clone

cd Tracking_Program_for_accounting

# (Optional) create venv
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```bash
python main.py
```
On first launch you‚Äôll be prompted to create an admin user.

## Data locations
- Database: `data/app.db`
- Documents: stored as file paths; opened with the OS default app

## Core concepts
- Product IDs: year‚Äëprefixed, category/subcategory coded (auto‚Äëgenerated)
- Batch analytics: allocations from imports (FIFO) drive COGS and profit
- FX handling: amounts normalized to Base Currency using transaction‚Äëdate rate

## UI tips
- Use the toolbar or tabs (Home/Imports/Sales/Expenses/Admin)
- Buttons are themed: Primary (Save/Refresh), Secondary (Cancel/Close), Success (Edit/Confirm), Danger (Delete)
- Tables support search, sort, and CSV export (where available)

## Troubleshooting
- If the window appears small, use the window‚Äôs green maximize button (macOS) or the maximize control (Windows/Linux). Most windows set sensible minimum sizes.
- If FX fetch fails, you can enter the rate manually; cached rates are used on subsequent runs.

### üóÉÔ∏è Data Storage Overview
- **SQLite (data/app.db)**
  - imports, inventory, expenses, product_codes
  - users (login), audit_log (history)
  - import_batches (batches) and sale_batch_allocations (sales-to-batch links)
- **CSV (data/)**
  - returns.csv
  - customers.csv (optional), suppliers.csv (optional)

This hybrid model keeps analytics consistent and still allows lightweight CSV exports.

CSV compatibility:
- Sales header field `SellingPriceBase` is preferred; legacy `SellingPriceUSD` is still supported for backward compatibility


### üß† Tips
- On Record Import and Record Sale, type in Supplier/Customer fields to see live suggestions.
- If a category/subcategory is new, the app will ask for 3‚Äëdigit codes once, then auto-generate IDs.
- Expenses can be linked to imports; documents can be attached and opened via the app.

#### Import expenses & multi-line import orders

We recently introduced a richer import model to support multi-line import orders and a centralized expense system. Key points:

- Multi-line import orders
  - Each import can contain one or more import lines (for different SKUs, quantities, or unit prices). These are stored in the `import_lines` table and linked to the parent `imports` row.
  - Each import line has an original ordered unit price and quantity which are the canonical base values used for allocation and reporting.

- Expense linking
  - Expenses can be linked to one or more imports using `expense_import_links`. Link one expense to multiple imports (or leave an expense unlinked).
  - Expenses are stored in their original currency and converted to the import's currency (by transaction date) during allocation.

- Payment-weighted expense allocation (how extra cost is apportioned)
  - For each import, the app computes a `line_total = ordered_unit_price * quantity` for every import line, then `total_order_value = sum(line_total)`.
  - Each line's share of total expenses is its line_total / total_order_value.
  - The extra expense per unit for a line = (line_share * total_expenses) / quantity.
  - Final per-unit cost = original_unit_price + extra_expense_per_unit.
  - This is implemented in `db/recompute_import_batches(import_id)` and runs automatically when linked expenses change.

- Cost columns and semantics
  - `unit_cost_orig` ‚Äî the original import unit price (preserved for historical, non-inclusive reporting).
  - `unit_cost` ‚Äî the expense-inclusive unit cost after allocation (used for "include import-related expenses" reporting).
  - `unit_cost_base` ‚Äî the `unit_cost` converted to the configured base currency using the import FX at time of import.

- Reporting behavior
  - Batch analytics and profit reports have a toggle: "Include import-related expenses".
  - Non-inclusive reports use `unit_cost_orig` (original import price); inclusive reports use `unit_cost`.
  - This keeps non-inclusive historical reporting reproducible while giving an option to see expense-adjusted margins.

- Backfill and historical sales
  - We do NOT automatically overwrite historical `sale_batch_allocations` by default. If you want historical sales to reflect the new inclusive costs, we can provide an optional backfill script that updates `sale_batch_allocations.unit_cost` from `import_batches.unit_cost`. This is deliberate ‚Äî changing past reported COGS can affect audits and reporting consistency.
  - If you need a backfill, specify the policy (all allocations, allocations since a date, or only unfinalized allocations) and we will add an idempotent migration script and optional audit logging.
